# Smoke vs Sanity Testing

### What is Smoke Testing?
A **high-level check** that verifies basic functionality to see if the build is stable enough for further testing.

### What is Sanity Testing?
A **focused check** that ensures specific new features or bug fixes work properly.

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Smoke Testing | Sanity Testing |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Purpose | Check build stability | Check specific functionality |
| Scope | Broad | Narrow |
| When Done | Early in testing cycle | After minor code changes |
| Automation | Often automated | Usually manual |
| Time | Quick | Short and focused |

---

### Example
- **Smoke:** Can the app launch and allow login?  
- **Sanity:** Does the new “Forgot Password” fix work correctly?

---

### Conclusion
Smoke Testing confirms if testing can begin, while Sanity Testing confirms if recent changes are working as expected.
