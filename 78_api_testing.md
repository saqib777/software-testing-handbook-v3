# API Testing

### What is API Testing?
API Testing validates **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** to ensure they work correctly, securely, and efficiently.  
It focuses on the **logic and data exchange** between systems, not the UI.

---

### Why Itâ€™s Important
Most modern apps rely on APIs for communication.  
API Testing ensures:
- Correct data flow between services  
- Proper error handling  
- Reliable performance  

---

### Goals
- Verify response codes and formats  
- Validate authentication and data integrity  
- Check performance and reliability  

---

### Example
**Scenario:**  
Testing a `/login` API to ensure it returns a 200 status and correct user token for valid credentials.

---

### Tools
- Postman  
- SoapUI  
- RestAssured  
- Katalon Studio  

---

### Common Issues
- Incorrect status codes  
- Data mismatches  
- Slow or inconsistent responses  

---

### Best Practices
- Validate both positive and negative cases  
- Automate API tests where possible  
- Include performance and security checks  

---

### Conclusion
API Testing ensures **backend systems communicate correctly and securely**, forming the backbone of modern applications.
