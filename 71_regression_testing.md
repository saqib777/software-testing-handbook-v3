# Regression Testing

### What is Regression Testing?
Regression Testing ensures that **new code changes don’t break existing functionality**.  
It’s performed after fixes, updates, or enhancements.

---

### Why It’s Important
Even small changes can unintentionally affect other parts of the system.  
Regression Testing confirms:
- Old features still work correctly  
- No side effects from new code  
- System stability after changes  

---

### Goals
- Identify and fix reintroduced bugs  
- Maintain consistent system behavior  
- Validate integration between modules  

---

### Example
**Scenario:**  
After fixing a bug in the login module, testers re-run old test cases to confirm signup and dashboard modules still work.

---

### Tools
- Selenium  
- Jenkins (for CI/CD regression suites)  
- Katalon Studio  
- TestNG  

---

### Common Issues
- Skipping old test cases after updates  
- Lack of automation leading to missed regressions  

---

### Best Practices
- Maintain an updated regression test suite  
- Automate critical flows  
- Run regression tests after every release cycle  

---

### Conclusion
Regression Testing ensures **software stability** and confidence after every change.
