# GUI Testing

### What is GUI Testing?
GUI (Graphical User Interface) Testing focuses on checking the **visual elements and user interactions** of an application — buttons, menus, forms, colors, and layouts.

---

### Why It’s Important
Users interact with the interface first. A broken or inconsistent UI damages trust.  
GUI Testing ensures:
- The interface looks and works as designed  
- All visual elements are consistent and functional  
- User interactions behave correctly  

---

### Goals
- Verify visual consistency  
- Validate UI behavior under different devices/resolutions  
- Check accessibility and responsiveness  

---

### Example
**Scenario:**  
Testing a login screen — verifying button color, font alignment, hover states, and correct error messages.

---

### Tools
- Selenium  
- TestComplete  
- Ranorex  
- Katalon Studio  

---

### Common Issues
- Misaligned or hidden UI elements  
- Non-responsive layouts  
- Broken links or inactive buttons  

---

### Best Practices
- Maintain consistent design standards  
- Use automated visual comparison tools  
- Test across multiple devices and browsers  

---

### Conclusion
GUI Testing ensures your software’s **look and feel matches user expectations** and design requirements.
