## Reliability Testing

### What is Reliability Testing?
Reliability Testing is done to check how **consistently and dependably** a software system performs under specific conditions for a given period of time.  
In simple terms — it’s about making sure the system **keeps working without failing**, even after long or repeated use.

---

### Why is Reliability Testing Important?
Software may pass functional tests but still fail after hours or days of continuous use.  
Reliability Testing helps to:
- Ensure stable performance over time  
- Detect memory leaks, crashes, and slowdowns  
- Build user confidence in the system’s durability  
- Measure how often and how severely failures occur  

---

### Goals of Reliability Testing
- Measure how often the software fails (failure rate)  
- Identify weak points that could cause system breakdown  
- Evaluate recovery mechanisms after failure  
- Estimate product reliability in real environments  

---

### Key Metrics in Reliability Testing
| Metric | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)** | Average time the system runs before a failure occurs |
| **MTTR (Mean Time To Repair)** | Average time taken to recover from a failure |
| **Failure Rate** | How frequently failures happen within a time frame |
| **Reliability Growth** | Improvement in reliability as issues are fixed and retested |

### Types of Reliability Testing
1. **Feature Testing**  
   Ensures that every feature performs reliably under normal and stress conditions.

2. **Load Testing**  
   Checks if the system remains stable under expected user load.

3. **Regression Reliability Testing**  
   Runs previously passed tests multiple times to ensure consistent results.

4. **Stress Testing**  
   Pushes the system beyond its limits to observe how and when it fails.

5. **Recovery Testing**  
   Evaluates how well the system recovers from a crash or failure (often overlaps with reliability testing).

### Common Issues Found
- Memory leaks after prolonged use  
- System crashes or hangs during extended sessions  
- Slow performance over time  
- Data loss after failures  
- Resource exhaustion (CPU, RAM, storage)  

---

### Tools Used
- **LoadRunner**  
- **JMeter**  
- **Locust**  
- **Nagios / Dynatrace** (for monitoring reliability over time)  
- **Custom reliability scripts or automation frameworks**

---

### Best Practices
- Simulate real-world usage conditions  
- Run tests for extended durations (hours or days)  
- Monitor system resources continuously  
- Track failure patterns and correlate with user actions  
- Automate reliability tests to repeat long-term scenarios  

---

### Example
**Scenario:** Testing an online video streaming platform  
- Run the app continuously for 72 hours  
- Simulate hundreds of users streaming videos simultaneously  
- Track crashes, response times, and memory usage  
- Verify recovery after forced restarts  

---

### Benefits of Reliability Testing
- Detects issues that appear only after prolonged use  
- Improves overall system stability and performance  
- Enhances customer trust and satisfaction  
- Reduces post-release failures and maintenance costs  

---

### Conclusion
Reliability Testing ensures that software doesn’t just **work once** — it works **consistently and continuously**.  
It helps teams build dependable, stable, and trustworthy applications that users can rely on over time.
