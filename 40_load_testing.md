# Load Testing

### What is Load Testing?
Load Testing measures how the system performs under **expected user load**.  
It checks whether the application can handle the anticipated number of users or transactions **without slowing down or crashing**.

---

### Why Itâ€™s Important
Real-world usage involves multiple users performing actions simultaneously.  
Load Testing helps ensure:
- The system performs well under normal usage  
- Resources are allocated efficiently  
- There are no hidden performance bottlenecks  

---

### Goals
- Determine maximum operating capacity  
- Identify performance thresholds  
- Monitor response times under varying loads  

---

### Example
Testing a ticket booking website with 5,000 concurrent users to check if all pages load within 3 seconds.

---

### Tools
- Apache JMeter  
- LoadRunner  
- NeoLoad  
- Locust  

---

### Common Issues
- Slow responses during traffic spikes  
- Database timeouts  
- Resource exhaustion  
- Poor scalability  

---

### Best Practices
- Start with small loads and gradually increase  
- Use realistic user behavior scripts  
- Monitor system health (CPU, RAM, network)  
- Re-test after optimization  

---

### Conclusion
Load Testing ensures your software can **handle expected user activity smoothly**, avoiding crashes or lag in real-world conditions.
