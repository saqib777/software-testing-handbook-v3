# Endurance Testing

### What is Endurance Testing?
Endurance Testing (also called **Soak Testing**) checks system performance when running under **continuous load for an extended period** — hours or even days.  
It helps identify issues that appear **only after long-term use**.

---

### Why It’s Important
Some bugs (like memory leaks or performance degradation) only show up after continuous operation.  
Endurance Testing ensures:
- Long-term stability and reliability  
- Efficient resource usage over time  
- No gradual slowdowns or crashes  

---

### Goals
- Detect performance degradation over time  
- Identify resource leaks  
- Ensure sustained performance under constant load  

---

### Example
Running an online streaming platform continuously for 72 hours with 500 concurrent users to monitor stability and resource consumption.

---

### Tools
- JMeter  
- LoadRunner  
- Locust  
- Dynatrace / New Relic for monitoring  

---

### Common Issues
- Memory leaks  
- CPU overload after long runs  
- Gradual performance decline  
- Resource exhaustion  

---

### Best Practices
- Simulate real-world conditions  
- Run tests for long durations  
- Continuously monitor metrics (CPU, memory, DB connections)  
- Restart and recovery testing after endurance cycles  

---

### Conclusion
Endurance Testing ensures your system remains **stable and efficient during continuous use**, even after days of nonstop operation.
