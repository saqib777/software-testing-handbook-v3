# Recovery Testing

### What is Recovery Testing?
Recovery Testing evaluates how well a system **recovers after a crash, failure, or other unexpected interruptions**.  
It checks if operations resume normally and **data integrity is preserved**.

---

### Why It’s Important
Systems fail — hardware crashes, networks go down, or power cuts happen.  
Recovery Testing ensures:
- The system can restart gracefully  
- Data isn’t lost or corrupted  
- Users can continue work after recovery  

---

### Goals
- Validate backup and restore procedures  
- Test system behavior after forced failures  
- Measure recovery time and accuracy  

---

### Example
**Scenario:**  
During an online transaction, the server crashes. After reboot, the app must restore data and show the correct transaction status.

---

### Tools
- Chaos Monkey  
- LoadRunner  
- JMeter  
- Custom scripts for failure injection  

---

### Common Issues
- Lost or inconsistent data  
- Partial recovery or corrupted states  
- Missing logs or rollback mechanisms  

---

### Best Practices
- Simulate different failure types  
- Automate recovery validation  
- Keep detailed backup and rollback plans  

---

### Conclusion
Recovery Testing ensures your system can **bounce back from failure** without data loss or service disruption.
