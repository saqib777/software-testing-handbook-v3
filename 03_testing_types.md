# Testing Types

1. **Functional Testing**  
   Ensures the system works according to requirements.  
   Example: A shopping cart correctly adds and removes products.

2. **Non-Functional Testing**  
   Tests aspects like performance, usability, security.  
   Example: Checking if the website loads within 2 seconds under heavy traffic.

3. **Regression Testing**  
   Ensures new changes do not break old features.  
   Example: After adding a discount feature, verifying checkout still works.

4. **Smoke Testing**  
   Quick checks to confirm major functions are working.  
   Example: After deployment, verifying if login page loads successfully.
