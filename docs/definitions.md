# Software Testing Definitions

## 1. Defect (Bug / Issue)
A defect is a deviation from the expected behavior of the software.  
**Example:** Expected login → dashboard, but it shows a blank page.

---

## 2. Severity vs Priority
- **Severity** → How serious the defect is.  
- **Priority** → How urgent it is to fix.  

**Examples:**
- High Severity, Low Priority → Crash with 500-character username.  
- Low Severity, High Priority → Company name misspelled.

---

## 3. Regression Testing
Checks that new code changes haven’t broken existing features.  
**Example:** Add UPI payment → re-test Credit Card, PayPal.

---

## 4. Smoke Testing
Quick checks of critical features (app launch, login, add-to-cart).  
If this fails, stop further testing.

---

## 5. Sanity Testing
Focused check after small changes.  
**Example:** Verify search bar works correctly after a bug fix.
