# Localization Testing

### What is Localization Testing?
Localization Testing checks whether the software has been **adapted correctly for a specific region or language**.  
It ensures that translated content, date formats, currency, and cultural aspects are displayed properly.

---

### Why It’s Important
When an app is launched globally, it should **feel native** to each region.  
Localization Testing ensures:
- Accurate translations  
- Proper formatting (dates, numbers, currency)  
- No text overflow or layout issues  
- Region-appropriate visuals and symbols  

---

### Goals
- Validate translation accuracy and UI adjustments  
- Ensure all region-specific settings work  
- Verify text, symbols, and direction (like RTL for Arabic)  

---

### Example
**Scenario:**  
Testing an e-commerce site’s French version to verify currency changes to euros, dates follow DD/MM/YYYY, and translations are contextually correct.

---

### Tools
- Globalyzer  
- SDL Passolo  
- Alchemy Catalyst  
- BrowserStack (for region simulation)

---

### Common Issues
- Text truncation or overlapping  
- Hardcoded language strings  
- Incorrect date or currency formats  
- Missing translations  

---

### Best Practices
- Test with native language speakers  
- Validate both functional and visual correctness  
- Check encoding (UTF-8) and special characters  
- Maintain translation consistency across screens  

---

### Conclusion
Localization Testing ensures your product **feels local and natural** in every region, boosting user comfort and engagement.
