## Recovery Testing

### What is Recovery Testing?
Recovery Testing checks how well a system can **recover after a crash, hardware failure, power loss, or other unexpected interruptions**.  
In simple words — it’s testing whether your app can get back on its feet after something goes wrong.

---

### Why is Recovery Testing Important?
No system is perfect. Servers crash, networks fail, and power can go out anytime.  
Recovery Testing helps ensure:
- Minimal data loss during unexpected failures  
- The system resumes normal operation automatically  
- User sessions and transactions remain safe  
- Stability and reliability under real-world conditions  

---

### Goals of Recovery Testing
- Verify that the system can restart successfully after failure  
- Ensure no corruption of files or databases  
- Validate that interrupted operations resume correctly  
- Check if backup and restore processes work properly  
- Measure recovery time and data consistency  

---

### When is it Performed?
Recovery Testing is typically done **after system testing** and before release — especially for critical applications like banking, healthcare, or e-commerce systems.

---

### Types of Failures Tested
1. **System Crash** – Simulate OS or application crash  
2. **Network Failure** – Disconnect or slow down the network  
3. **Power Failure** – Turn off the system during critical operations  
4. **Hardware Failure** – Simulate disk or memory failure  
5. **Software Failure** – Trigger bugs that cause forced application restarts  

---

### Common Issues Found
- Data corruption after restart  
- Unsaved user actions lost after crash  
- Backup files not restoring correctly  
- Inconsistent states after partial transactions  
- System fails to auto-recover or log the error  

---

### Tools Used
- **Chaos Monkey** (for simulating random failures)  
- **LoadRunner** (for stress and failure testing)  
- **Resilience4j** (for fault tolerance in Java apps)  
- **Custom recovery scripts and simulators**  

---

### Best Practices
- Always test critical modules like payment, login, and database connections  
- Simulate real-world interruptions (e.g., power cut, crash mid-transaction)  
- Verify auto-save and auto-recovery mechanisms  
- Test both manual and automatic recovery procedures  
- Ensure proper error messages and logs are generated  

---

### Example
**Scenario:** Testing a banking application  
- Start transferring money between two accounts  
- Simulate a sudden power failure during the transaction  
- Restart the system and check:  
  - Was the transaction completed, reversed, or logged correctly?  
  - Did the app show a meaningful error message?  
  - Was user data preserved after restart?  

---

### Conclusion
Recovery Testing ensures your system can handle the unexpected — crashes, failures, or power loss — and still protect user data and reliability.  
It’s all about **resilience** — making sure your software can fall, recover, and continue working safely.
