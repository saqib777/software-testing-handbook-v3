# Exploratory Testing

### What is Exploratory Testing?
Exploratory Testing is a **hands-on testing approach** where testers actively explore the application without predefined test cases.  
It relies on the tester’s **experience, creativity, and intuition**.

---

### Why It’s Important
Not all bugs can be found through scripted tests.  
Exploratory Testing helps:
- Uncover hidden or unexpected issues  
- Improve tester understanding of the product  
- Encourage critical thinking and real-world use  

---

### Goals
- Discover new bugs through unscripted exploration  
- Evaluate usability and user flow  
- Find gaps in existing test coverage  

---

### Example
**Scenario:**  
A tester randomly explores an e-commerce app — adding, removing, and updating items in the cart in different sequences to see if errors occur.

---

### Tools
- Session-based test management (e.g., Testmo, PractiTest)  
- Screen recording tools (for documentation)  
- Mind maps for tracking explored areas  

---

### Common Issues
- Poor documentation of test sessions  
- Missed areas due to lack of focus  
- Difficulty reproducing found bugs  

---

### Best Practices
- Define session goals before exploring  
- Take notes or record findings  
- Mix exploratory with scripted testing  
- Encourage collaboration and debrief sessions  

---

### Conclusion
Exploratory Testing helps testers **think beyond scripts**, finding real-world bugs and usability issues that automation often misses.
