# Scalability Testing

### What is Scalability Testing?
Scalability Testing evaluates how well software **handles increasing workloads** — such as more users, transactions, or data.  
It measures performance when scaling **up (hardware)** or **out (users)**.

---

### Why It’s Important
As user traffic grows, systems must stay fast and stable.  
Scalability Testing ensures:
- The system scales efficiently  
- Response times remain acceptable  
- No resource bottlenecks occur  

---

### Goals
- Measure performance under varying loads  
- Identify system limits and breaking points  
- Evaluate resource usage (CPU, memory, bandwidth)  

---

### Example
**Scenario:**  
Gradually increasing concurrent users from 100 to 10,000 on a website and monitoring response time and throughput.

---

### Tools
- Apache JMeter  
- LoadRunner  
- Gatling  
- k6  

---

### Common Issues
- Memory leaks  
- Unoptimized database queries  
- Poor load balancing  
- Resource saturation  

---

### Best Practices
- Test incrementally (step-by-step scaling)  
- Monitor system metrics closely  
- Automate load generation and reporting  

---

### Conclusion
Scalability Testing ensures your software can **grow smoothly under demand**, maintaining performance as user traffic increases.
