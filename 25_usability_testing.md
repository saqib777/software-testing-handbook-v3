## Usability Testing

### What is Usability Testing?
Usability Testing is done to check how easy, intuitive, and user-friendly an application is.  
In simple terms — it’s about finding out if real users can **use your product comfortably without confusion or frustration**.

### Why is Usability Testing Important?
A product can be technically perfect but still fail if users find it confusing or hard to navigate.  
Usability Testing helps to:
- Improve user satisfaction  
- Reduce user errors  
- Increase engagement and retention  
- Identify design flaws early  

---

### Goals of Usability Testing
- Verify if users can complete key tasks easily  
- Identify where users struggle or hesitate  
- Check if navigation and labels make sense  
- Evaluate visual clarity and consistency  
- Measure overall satisfaction and comfort

### Types of Usability Testing
1. **Exploratory Testing**  
   Done in early design stages to gather feedback on layout, flow, and usability.

2. **Assessment Testing**  
   Checks how easily users can perform specific tasks.

3. **Comparative Testing**  
   Compares two or more designs or products to see which one users prefer.

4. **Remote Usability Testing**  
   Conducted online — users test from their own environment using screen-sharing tools.

5. **In-person Usability Testing**  
   Observing users directly as they interact with the app or website.

### Common Issues Found
- Confusing navigation or unclear buttons  
- Too many steps to complete a simple task  
- Poor error messages or lack of feedback  
- Inconsistent layout or design  
- Small touch targets on mobile screens  

---

### Methods Used
- **Observation and Screen Recording** – Watching users interact  
- **Surveys and Questionnaires** – Collecting direct feedback  
- **Think-Aloud Protocol** – Users verbalize their thoughts while testing  
- **A/B Testing** – Comparing two versions of a feature or design

### Tools Used
- **Hotjar**  
- **Maze**  
- **Lookback**  
- **UserTesting**  
- **Optimal Workshop**

### Best Practices
- Define clear usability goals before testing  
- Choose a small, diverse group of real users  
- Focus on critical tasks, not just aesthetics  
- Avoid leading questions — let users explore naturally  
- Record and analyze all sessions to find patterns

### Example
**Scenario:** Testing a flight booking website  
- Ask users to book a one-way ticket from Delhi to Mumbai  
- Observe if they can easily find flight filters (price, date, timing)  
- Note if they get stuck during payment or confirmation steps  
- Collect their overall feedback about ease of use

### Conclusion
Usability Testing helps you see your product through your users’ eyes.  
It’s not about testing code — it’s about testing **experience**.  
A well-tested product doesn’t just work — it feels effortless to use.
