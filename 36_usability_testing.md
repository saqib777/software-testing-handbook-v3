# Usability Testing

### What is Usability Testing?
Usability Testing checks how **easy and intuitive** it is for real users to interact with your product.  
It focuses on **user experience (UX)** — not just functionality.

It answers the question:  
**"Can people use this software easily and effectively?"**

### Why It’s Important
Even a bug-free product can fail if users find it confusing or hard to navigate.  
Usability Testing ensures that:
- Users understand what to do without training  
- Navigation is simple and consistent  
- The interface is visually clear and accessible  

---

### Goals
- Identify confusing or unclear elements  
- Test real-world tasks and workflows  
- Measure user satisfaction and ease of use  
- Improve design based on actual feedback

### Key Areas
| Area | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Learnability** | How quickly can a new user start using it? |
| **Efficiency** | How fast can users complete a task? |
| **Memorability** | Can returning users remember how to use it? |
| **Error Prevention** | Are users guided to avoid mistakes? |
| **Satisfaction** | Do users enjoy using it? |

### Example
**Scenario:**  
Testing an online booking app with real users to observe if they can book a ticket without help, and noting where they hesitate or get stuck.

---

### Methods
- **Observation Testing** – watch users perform tasks  
- **Surveys and Feedback Forms**  
- **A/B Testing** – compare two designs  
- **Think-Aloud Protocol** – users verbalize thoughts while using it  

---

### Tools
- Maze  
- Hotjar  
- UserTesting  
- Lookback  
- Figma (for prototype testing)

---

### Best Practices
- Test with real users (not just developers)  
- Keep tasks realistic  
- Record sessions for later review  
- Gather both qualitative and quantitative data  

---

### Conclusion
Usability Testing makes sure your software is **simple, intuitive, and enjoyable** — improving user satisfaction and retention.
