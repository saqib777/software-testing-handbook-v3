# Localization Testing

### What is Localization Testing?
Localization Testing verifies that the software has been **adapted for a specific language, culture, and region**.  
It ensures content, formatting, and symbols are **accurate and culturally appropriate**.

### Why It’s Important
Global users expect products to feel native.  
Localization Testing ensures:
- Correct language translation  
- Proper date, currency, and number formats  
- Culturally suitable images and UI layout  

---

### Goals
- Validate translation accuracy  
- Check layout and text rendering  
- Verify local formats and input methods

### Example
**Scenario:**  
Testing the French version of an e-commerce site — confirming that prices show in euros, and dates follow DD/MM/YYYY format.
