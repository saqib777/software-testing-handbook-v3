# Reliability Testing

### What is Reliability Testing?
Reliability Testing checks whether the software **performs consistently and correctly over time** under expected conditions.  
It focuses on **stability, fault tolerance, and consistent performance**.

---

### Why It’s Important
Users expect dependable software that doesn’t crash or behave unpredictably.  
Reliability Testing ensures:
- Stable performance over long durations  
- Consistent outputs without errors  
- Recovery from minor failures  

---

### Goals
- Measure mean time between failures (MTBF)  
- Evaluate recovery after crashes  
- Identify weak points under continuous use  

---

### Example
**Scenario:**  
Running a web server for 72 hours continuously to check for crashes, memory leaks, or slowdowns.

---

### Tools
- LoadRunner  
- JMeter  
- Reliability Workbench  
- Custom monitoring scripts  

---

### Common Issues
- Gradual performance degradation  
- Resource leaks  
- System crashes after prolonged use  

---

### Best Practices
- Test under realistic load and duration  
- Monitor logs and system health  
- Combine reliability with stress testing  

---

### Conclusion
Reliability Testing ensures your application **runs dependably and continuously**, even under long-term operation.
