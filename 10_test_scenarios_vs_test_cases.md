# Test Scenarios vs Test Cases

## 1. Introduction
In software testing, both **test scenarios** and **test cases** play key roles in ensuring software quality.  
However, they serve **different purposes** and operate at **different levels of detail**.  
Understanding the distinction helps in planning, designing, and executing tests more effectively.

---

## 2. What is a Test Scenario?

A **Test Scenario** is a high-level description of what to test.  
It focuses on **end-to-end user flows** or **functional behaviors** rather than exact steps.  

**Example:**
> Verify that the user can successfully log in using valid credentials.

Scenarios represent *"what to test"*, not *"how to test it"*.  

They are especially useful in **agile testing** where time is limited and teams focus on functionality coverage.

---

### Characteristics of Test Scenarios:
- Derived from requirements or user stories.  
- Broad in scope and cover end-to-end flows.  
- Easy to understand by business analysts, developers, and testers.  
- Usually one scenario can have multiple test cases under it.  
- Great for smoke and sanity testing.

---

### Advantages:
- Saves time in test planning.  
- Ensures business logic is covered.  
- Helps non-technical stakeholders understand testing goals.  

### Limitations:
- Lack of detailed validation steps.  
- Not ideal for automation or regression testing on its own.

## 3. What is a Test Case?

A **Test Case** is a detailed document that specifies **exact steps, data, and expected results** to validate one aspect of an application.

**Example:**

| Step No. | Action | Input | Expected Result |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Navigate to Login page | — | Login page opens |
| 2 | Enter Username | user123 | — |
| 3 | Enter Password | pass123 | — |
| 4 | Click “Login” | — | Dashboard should load |

A test case represents *"how to test"* and provides **reproducible steps**.

---

### Characteristics of Test Cases:
- Highly detailed with clear preconditions and expected outcomes.  
- Derived from test scenarios.  
- Useful for manual and automated testing.  
- Focused on validation, negative testing, and edge cases.  

---

### Advantages:
- Ensures maximum coverage of functionality.  
- Helps track defects to exact steps.  
- Facilitates test automation.  
- Ensures reproducibility for regression testing.  

### Limitations:
- Time-consuming to write and maintain.  
- May be too detailed for early agile phases.

## 4. Key Differences Table

| Aspect | Test Scenario | Test Case |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Definition | What to test | How to test |
| Level | High-level | Detailed |
| Objective | Ensure functional coverage | Validate specific functionality |
| Derived From | Requirements/User stories | Test scenarios |
| Documentation | Brief | Step-by-step |
| Use in Agile | Preferred | Sometimes skipped |
| Automation | Harder to automate | Can be automated |
| Stakeholders | Business + QA | QA only |

---

## 5. Example Mapping

**User Story:**  
> As a registered user, I want to log into my account to access my dashboard.

| Test Scenario | Related Test Cases |
|----------------|------------------|
| Verify user can log in with valid credentials | TC_01: Login with valid username/password |
| Verify login fails with invalid credentials | TC_02: Login with wrong password |
| Verify error message displays for blank fields | TC_03: Empty username/password validation |

---

## 6. Best Practices
- Start with scenarios, then derive cases.  
- Ensure each requirement maps to at least one test scenario.  
- Keep scenarios simple and business-focused.  
- Write reusable and atomic test cases.  
- Keep both updated when requirements change.

---

## 7. Summary

| Point | Scenario | Case |
|--------|------------|------|
| Focus | End-user goal | Implementation validation |
| Detail Level | Broad | Granular |
| Ideal Use | Acceptance / Smoke / Agile testing | Regression / Automation / Detailed validation |
| Ownership | QA + Business | QA |
