# Functional Testing

### What is Functional Testing?
Functional Testing checks whether the software **performs its intended functions correctly** according to the requirements.  
It focuses on **what the system does**, not how it does it.

---

### Why It’s Important
This type of testing ensures that each feature or function:
- Works as expected  
- Produces the correct output  
- Handles valid and invalid inputs correctly  

---

### Goals
- Validate business logic  
- Confirm correct data flow  
- Ensure integration between modules  

---

### Example
**Scenario:**  
Testing the “Login” function — entering valid and invalid credentials and checking if access is granted or denied appropriately.

---

### Tools
- Selenium  
- Katalon Studio  
- TestComplete  
- Postman (for API functionality)

---

### Common Issues
- Missing functionality  
- Incorrect data handling  
- UI not triggering expected actions  
- Integration failures  

---

### Best Practices
- Use requirement-based test cases  
- Include both positive and negative scenarios  
- Automate repetitive functional checks  
- Keep traceability between test cases and requirements  

---

### Conclusion
Functional Testing ensures your software **does what it’s supposed to do**, building confidence in its core features.
