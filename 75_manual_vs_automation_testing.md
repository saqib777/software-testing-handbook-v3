# Manual vs Automation Testing

### What is Manual Testing?
Manual Testing is when **testers execute test cases themselves** without using automation tools.  
It focuses on human observation, usability, and exploratory aspects.

### What is Automation Testing?
Automation Testing uses **software tools and scripts** to execute tests automatically, improving speed and accuracy for repetitive tasks.

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Manual Testing | Automation Testing |
|--------|----------------|--------------------|
| Execution | Performed by humans | Performed by tools/scripts |
| Speed | Slower | Much faster |
| Accuracy | Can vary by tester | Consistent and precise |
| Best For | Exploratory, usability, and ad-hoc tests | Regression, performance, and large-scale tests |
| Tools | None (manual process) | Selenium, Katalon, Cypress, etc. |

### Example
**Manual:** Checking color and layout of a login page.  
**Automation:** Running 100 login attempts with different credentials.

---

### When to Use Each
- **Manual:** When testing new features, user experience, or small projects.  
- **Automation:** When repeating tests across builds or multiple environments.

---

### Conclusion
Both have their place â€” **Manual Testing** adds human insight, while **Automation Testing** adds speed and consistency. A good QA strategy uses both.
