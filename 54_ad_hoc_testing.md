## Ad-hoc Testing

### What is Ad-hoc Testing?
Ad-hoc Testing is an **informal and unplanned** type of testing where testers explore the system randomly without test cases or documentation.  
The goal is to **find unexpected bugs through intuitive exploration**.

---

### Why It’s Important
It’s useful when you want to quickly check system behavior or test beyond documented scenarios.  
Ad-hoc Testing helps:
- Identify defects missed by structured testing  
- Use creativity to uncover edge cases  
- Test under real-world or random conditions  

---

### Goals
- Explore system freely without predefined steps  
- Validate stability and robustness  
- Quickly assess quality in limited time  

---

### Example
**Scenario:**  
A tester clicks through different pages, enters invalid data, or performs random user actions to see how the system reacts.

---

### Tools
- None specifically required (manual approach)  
- Optional: screen recorders, logging tools  

---

### Common Issues
- Lack of documentation or reproducibility  
- Missing systematic coverage  
- Inconsistent results between testers  

---

### Best Practices
- Focus on risky or complex areas  
- Record steps and outcomes  
- Combine with formal testing for better coverage  

---

### Conclusion
Ad-hoc Testing is a **spontaneous, creative approach** that helps uncover hidden issues that structured tests might miss.
