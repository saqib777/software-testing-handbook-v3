# Security Testing

### What is Security Testing?
Security Testing ensures that software systems are **protected against threats, vulnerabilities, and unauthorized access**.  
It validates the system’s ability to **safeguard data, maintain integrity, and enforce access control**.

---

### Why It’s Important
A secure system protects both the company and its users.  
Security Testing helps:
- Prevent data breaches and leaks  
- Identify weak points before attackers do  
- Build user trust and compliance  

---

### Goals
- Verify authentication and authorization  
- Test data encryption and privacy controls  
- Identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations  

---

### Example
**Scenario:**  
Testing a banking app’s login module for weak passwords, SQL injection, and data encryption during transactions.

---

### Tools
- OWASP ZAP  
- Burp Suite  
- Nessus  
- Acunetix  

---

### Common Issues
- Weak passwords or insecure authentication  
- Unencrypted data transmission  
- Cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection  
- Poor session handling  

---

### Best Practices
- Follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines  
- Encrypt sensitive data  
- Perform regular security audits  
- Use penetration testing before release  

---

### Conclusion
Security Testing ensures your system is **resilient against attacks and data breaches**, maintaining trust and compliance.
