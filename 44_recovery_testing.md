# Recovery Testing

### What is Recovery Testing?
Recovery Testing checks how well software **recovers after failures** such as crashes, hardware malfunctions, or network outages.  
It ensures that the system can **resume normal operation without data loss or corruption**.

---

### Why It’s Important
Failures happen — servers crash, connections drop, or power cuts out.  
Recovery Testing ensures:
- The system handles failures gracefully  
- Data is preserved and consistent  
- Automatic recovery or restart mechanisms work properly  

---

### Goals
- Validate backup and restore procedures  
- Test auto-reconnect and retry mechanisms  
- Confirm that system returns to a stable state after failure  

---

### Example
**Scenario:**  
A banking system crash during a transaction — the test checks if it restores the last saved state and maintains transaction accuracy after recovery.

---

### Tools
- Chaos Monkey (for fault injection)  
- JMeter  
- LoadRunner  
- Custom scripts to simulate crashes  

---

### Common Issues
- Data loss or corruption after failure  
- Slow or failed recovery  
- Incomplete transactions after restart  
- Logs or sessions missing  

---

### Best Practices
- Simulate different failure types (power, network, process)  
- Verify recovery time and data accuracy  
- Automate fault injection for repeatability  
- Document recovery procedures  

---

### Conclusion
Recovery Testing ensures that your system can **recover quickly and safely** from unexpected failures without losing data or functionality.
