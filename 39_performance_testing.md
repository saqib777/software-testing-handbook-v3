# Performance Testing

### What is Performance Testing?
Performance Testing checks how **fast, stable, and responsive** the software is under expected workloads.  
It helps identify **bottlenecks, speed issues, and performance limits** before users do.

---

### Why It’s Important
Users expect smooth, fast experiences. Slow systems cause frustration and drop-offs.  
Performance Testing ensures:
- The system can handle real-world traffic  
- Response times meet expectations  
- The app remains stable under load  

---

### Goals
- Measure system speed, stability, and scalability  
- Detect performance issues early  
- Ensure optimal resource usage (CPU, memory, bandwidth)  
- Set benchmarks for future improvements  

---

### Key Metrics
| Metric | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Response Time** | Time taken to respond to a request |
| **Throughput** | Number of requests processed per second |
| **Latency** | Delay between request and response |
| **Resource Utilization** | CPU, memory, disk, and network usage |
| **Error Rate** | Number of failed transactions |

### Example
Testing an e-commerce site’s performance when 1,000 users browse products and add items to the cart simultaneously.

---

### Tools
- JMeter  
- LoadRunner  
- Gatling  
- Locust  
- BlazeMeter  

---

### Common Issues
- Slow database queries  
- Poor caching strategy  
- Server overload  
- Memory leaks or CPU spikes  

---

### Best Practices
- Test early and often  
- Simulate real-world conditions  
- Monitor both client and server performance  
- Automate performance tests in CI/CD pipelines  

---

### Conclusion
Performance Testing ensures your software stays **fast, efficient, and reliable** under all conditions.
