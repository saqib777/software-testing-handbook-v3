# Testing Levels

1. **Unit Testing**  
   - Tests individual components.  
   - Example: Testing a login function that verifies username and password.

2. **Integration Testing**  
   - Tests combined parts of the application.  
   - Example: Checking how login function interacts with database.

3. **System Testing**  
   - Tests the entire application as a whole.  
   - Example: Testing an ATM machine end-to-end (card insertion, PIN, withdrawal).

4. **Acceptance Testing**  
   - Ensures the system meets business requirements.  
   - Example: A client verifies an **e-commerce site** processes orders correctly.
