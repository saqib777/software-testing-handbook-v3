# Sanity Testing

### What is Sanity Testing?
Sanity Testing is a **focused check** to confirm that **specific bugs or changes** work as expected after a new build or patch.

---

### Why It’s Important
It saves time by testing **only the affected areas**, ensuring new features or fixes haven’t caused other issues.

---

### Goals
- Verify recent bug fixes or minor changes  
- Confirm system stability after small updates  
- Detect high-impact defects quickly  

---

### Example
**Scenario:**  
After fixing a payment gateway issue, testers verify that payments now go through correctly — without retesting the entire app.

---

### Tools
- Selenium  
- Katalon Studio  
- TestRail (for test case management)  

---

### Common Issues
- Overlapping with full regression testing  
- Missing indirect impact areas  

---

### Best Practices
- Keep sanity tests small and focused  
- Run them immediately after each patch  
- Prioritize critical and high-risk functions  

---

### Conclusion
Sanity Testing ensures **quick confidence** that recent changes work correctly before moving to broader regression tests.
