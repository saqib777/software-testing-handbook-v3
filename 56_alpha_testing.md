# Alpha Testing

### What is Alpha Testing?
Alpha Testing is **internal testing** performed by the development and QA teams before the product is released to real users.  
It happens **early in the release cycle**, often in a controlled environment.

---

### Why It’s Important
It’s the first stage of user testing that helps identify:
- Major functional and usability issues  
- Bugs before public release  
- Gaps between expected and actual behavior  

---

### Goals
- Detect and fix major defects early  
- Validate the product from a user perspective  
- Ensure product readiness for beta testing  

---

### Example
**Scenario:**  
An internal QA team tests a new chat app within the company before it’s released to external beta users.

---

### Tools
- Bug tracking tools (Jira, Bugzilla)  
- Test management systems  
- Log analyzers  

---

### Common Issues
- Limited test data  
- Biased testing by internal teams  
- Missing real-world user behavior  

---

### Best Practices
- Include internal users unfamiliar with the product  
- Combine manual and automated testing  
- Document and prioritize all issues found  

---

### Conclusion
Alpha Testing provides **early feedback and stability checks** before exposing the product to real users.
