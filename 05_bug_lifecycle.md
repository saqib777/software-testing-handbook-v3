# Bug Lifecycle

**Definition:**  
A bug lifecycle shows the process of a defect from discovery to closure.

**Phases:**  
1. New  
2. Assigned  
3. Open  
4. Fixed  
5. Retested  
6. Closed  
7. Reopened (if needed)

**Example:**  
During ATM testing, a bug is reported: *Machine dispenses wrong amount*.  
- Status changes from *New → Assigned → Fixed → Retested → Closed*.

**Defect**
Definition:
A defect is a deviation from the expected behavior of the software. It occurs when the actual output differs from the expected output.

Example:

Expected: Clicking "Login" with correct credentials takes the user to the dashboard.

Actual: Clicking "Login" results in a blank page.
