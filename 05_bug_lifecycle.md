# Bug Lifecycle

**Definition:**  
A bug lifecycle shows the process of a defect from discovery to closure.

**Phases:**  
1. New  
2. Assigned  
3. Open  
4. Fixed  
5. Retested  
6. Closed  
7. Reopened (if needed)

**Example:**  
During ATM testing, a bug is reported: *Machine dispenses wrong amount*.  
- Status changes from *New → Assigned → Fixed → Retested → Closed*.

**Defect**
Definition:
A defect is a deviation from the expected behavior of the software. It occurs when the actual output differs from the expected output.

Example:

Expected: Clicking "Login" with correct credentials takes the user to the dashboard.

Actual: Clicking "Login" results in a blank page.

**Severity vs Priority**

**Definition:**

Severity → Impact of the defect on the system. (How serious it is)

Priority → Urgency of fixing the defect. (How soon it should be fixed)

**Example Scenarios:**

High Severity, Low Priority:
The app crashes if you type a 500-character username, but very few users will ever do this.

Low Severity, High Priority:
Company name is misspelled on the homepage. Doesn’t affect functionality but must be fixed quickly.
