# Bug Lifecycle

**Definition:**  
A bug lifecycle shows the process of a defect from discovery to closure.

**Phases:**  
1. New  
2. Assigned  
3. Open  
4. Fixed  
5. Retested  
6. Closed  
7. Reopened (if needed)

**Example:**  
During ATM testing, a bug is reported: *Machine dispenses wrong amount*.  
- Status changes from *New → Assigned → Fixed → Retested → Closed*.
