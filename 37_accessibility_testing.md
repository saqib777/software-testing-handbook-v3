## Accessibility Testing

### What is Accessibility Testing?
Accessibility Testing ensures that software is **usable by people with disabilities**, such as those with visual, auditory, cognitive, or motor impairments.  
It’s about making your app inclusive and compliant with accessibility standards like **WCAG** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

---

### Why It’s Important
Accessibility isn’t just a legal requirement — it’s a moral and design responsibility.  
It ensures that:
- Everyone can access and use your product  
- Content is understandable by assistive technologies  
- The design doesn’t exclude anyone  

---

### Goals
- Verify compatibility with screen readers and assistive tools  
- Ensure text alternatives for images and icons  
- Test color contrast and text readability  
- Confirm full keyboard navigation  

---

### Accessibility Principles (POUR)
| Principle | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Perceivable** | Users can see or hear the content |
| **Operable** | Users can interact using keyboard or mouse |
| **Understandable** | Information and UI are clear and predictable |
| **Robust** | Compatible with assistive technologies |

### Example
**Scenario:**  
Testing a website to ensure that visually impaired users can navigate using screen readers and keyboard-only access.

---

### Tools
- WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)  
- AXE DevTools  
- NVDA (screen reader)  
- JAWS  
- Lighthouse (Accessibility Audit)

---

### Common Issues
- Missing alt text for images  
- Poor color contrast  
- Inaccessible forms  
- Keyboard traps (when navigation gets stuck)  

---

### Best Practices
- Follow WCAG 2.1 or later guidelines  
- Test using both manual and automated tools  
- Include accessibility testing in every sprint  
- Gather feedback from users with disabilities  

---

### Conclusion
Accessibility Testing ensures your software is **inclusive, usable, and fair** — opening it up to everyone, regardless of ability.
