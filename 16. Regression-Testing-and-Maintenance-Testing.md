## 16.1 Introduction

Software is rarely static — applications evolve as features are added, bugs are fixed, and systems integrate with new environments. Every change in the software can potentially introduce unexpected side effects.  
To ensure that these modifications do not break existing functionality, **Regression Testing** and **Maintenance Testing** are crucial.

These testing types focus on validating system stability and verifying that previously working features remain intact after updates or enhancements.

## 16.2 Regression Testing

### Definition:
Regression testing is the process of re-executing previously conducted test cases to verify that the recent code changes have not adversely affected existing features.

### Objectives:
- To detect unintended side effects caused by new modifications.  
- To ensure system stability after bug fixes, updates, or enhancements.  
- To maintain overall software quality during continuous integration.

### When It Is Performed:
- After code changes or refactoring.  
- After fixing defects.  
- During integration of new modules or features.  
- Before major releases or deployments.

### Methods of Regression Testing:
1. **Retest All:**  
   Every test case from the test suite is executed again.  
   - *Pros:* Complete coverage.  
   - *Cons:* Time-consuming and costly.

2. **Selective Regression Testing:**  
   Only a subset of relevant test cases are re-executed.  
   - *Pros:* Saves time by focusing on impacted areas.  
   - *Cons:* May miss some unintended effects.

3. **Automated Regression Testing:**  
   Uses automation tools (like Selenium, Cypress, or JUnit) to re-run scripts regularly.  
   - *Pros:* Ideal for continuous integration pipelines.  
   - *Cons:* Requires maintenance of test scripts.

4. **Progressive Regression Testing:**  
   Conducted when new test cases are added for new functionality.

## 16.3 Maintenance Testing

### Definition:
Maintenance testing is performed on an application after it has been deployed, to ensure that changes made post-release — such as bug fixes, environment upgrades, or migrations — do not introduce new issues.

### Objectives:
- To validate system stability after maintenance activities.  
- To ensure that patches, configuration changes, and updates work as expected.  
- To verify compatibility with evolving platforms, browsers, or databases.

### Types of Maintenance Testing:
1. **Corrective Maintenance Testing:**  
   Testing conducted after defects are fixed in production.

2. **Adaptive Maintenance Testing:**  
   Done when the system adapts to a new environment — for example, migrating from one OS or database to another.

3. **Perfective Maintenance Testing:**  
   When enhancements or performance improvements are made.

4. **Preventive Maintenance Testing:**  
   Focuses on identifying potential areas of failure before they occur.

## 16.4 Key Differences Between Regression and Maintenance Testing

| Aspect | Regression Testing | Maintenance Testing |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Focus** | Ensures new code doesn’t break existing features | Ensures updates and environment changes don’t affect functionality |
| **Performed** | After code changes or bug fixes | After deployment or maintenance activities |
| **Goal** | Detect side effects of new development | Validate stability during software evolution |
| **Scope** | Often limited to changed modules | May include system-wide checks |
| **Automation** | Commonly automated | Can be both manual and automated |

## 16.5 Best Practices
- Maintain a **regression suite** with critical, reusable test cases.  
- Automate repetitive regression tasks to save time.  
- Prioritize high-impact test cases for limited time windows.  
- Revalidate all interfaces after environmental updates.  
- Use version control to track test case evolution.  
- Combine regression testing with continuous integration pipelines.

## 16.6 Example Scenario

**Scenario:**  
An e-commerce application adds a new “Apply Coupon” feature.

**Regression Tests:**  
- Verify that adding items to the cart still works.  
- Ensure payment gateway still processes correctly.  
- Confirm product search and filtering remain functional.

**Maintenance Tests:**  
- After upgrading to a new database engine, ensure product details load correctly.  
- After patching the security library, verify that user authentication remains stable.

---

## 16.7 Tools Commonly Used
- **Regression Testing:** Selenium, TestNG, JUnit, Cypress, Jenkins, GitHub Actions  
- **Maintenance Testing:** Postman (for API changes), LoadRunner, JMeter, and automated deployment validation tools

---

## 16.8 Summary
Regression and maintenance testing together ensure long-term software stability.  
While regression testing safeguards against code-induced defects, maintenance testing secures the system from operational or environmental disruptions.

Both are essential pillars of a mature, continuous testing process.

## 16.9 End Notes
- Regression testing is **preventive** — it ensures past functionality stays intact.  
- Maintenance testing is **adaptive** — it ensures the system continues to work under evolving conditions.  
- Together, they protect both **code quality** and **system reliability** across software lifecycles.
