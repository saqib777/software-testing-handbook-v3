## Security Testing

### What is Security Testing?
Security Testing identifies **vulnerabilities, risks, and loopholes** in software that could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or misuse.  
Its goal is to ensure **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of data.

---

### Why Itâ€™s Important
Security flaws can damage user trust, cause financial loss, and harm reputation.  
This testing ensures:
- User data is protected  
- Systems are resilient to attacks  
- Access controls are properly enforced  

---

### Key Objectives
- Identify and fix vulnerabilities  
- Validate authentication and authorization  
- Ensure encryption and data protection  
- Test system resilience under attacks  

---

### Types of Security Testing
| Type | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Vulnerability Scanning** | Detect known weaknesses in code or configuration |
| **Penetration Testing** | Simulate real-world attacks to find loopholes |
| **Security Auditing** | Review code and configurations manually |
| **Ethical Hacking** | Authorized hacking to expose vulnerabilities |
| **Risk Assessment** | Evaluate and prioritize potential threats |

---

### Example
**Scenario:**  
Testing a banking web app to ensure only authorized users can transfer funds, and sensitive data is encrypted during transmission.

---

### Tools
- OWASP ZAP  
- Burp Suite  
- Nessus  
- Metasploit  
- Nmap  

---

### Common Issues
- Weak password policies  
- Unencrypted data transmission  
- Insecure APIs  
- Poor session management  
- SQL injection or XSS vulnerabilities  

---

### Best Practices
- Keep software and dependencies updated  
- Enforce strong authentication and encryption  
- Test regularly for new vulnerabilities  
- Conduct penetration tests before major releases  

---

### Conclusion
Security Testing protects both users and the business.  
It ensures your software stays **safe, trustworthy, and resilient** against evolving cyber threats.
