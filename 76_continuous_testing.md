## Continuous Testing

### What is Continuous Testing?
Continuous Testing is the process of **running automated tests throughout the software development lifecycle**, especially in CI/CD pipelines.  
It ensures every code change is validated immediately.

---

### Why Itâ€™s Important
It provides **real-time feedback** on code quality and stability, helping teams deliver faster and with confidence.

---

### Goals
- Detect defects early  
- Integrate testing into development cycles  
- Improve release speed and reliability  

---

### Example
**Scenario:**  
Every time a developer commits code to GitHub, automated tests run in Jenkins to verify that nothing breaks.

---

### Tools
- Jenkins  
- GitHub Actions  
- GitLab CI/CD  
- CircleCI  

---

### Common Issues
- Slow pipelines due to heavy tests  
- Flaky tests causing false failures  

---

### Best Practices
- Automate critical test cases  
- Run faster tests early, longer tests later  
- Integrate reports for quick feedback  

---

### Conclusion
Continuous Testing helps maintain **consistent quality and faster feedback**, ensuring smoother software delivery.
